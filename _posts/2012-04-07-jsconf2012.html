title: My JSConf 2012 talk

<p>Last week I travelled to US for the first time in my life to give a talk about V8 at JSConf 2012. The conference absolutely fantastic and allowed me to meet a lot of different people. If you know any other conference that would allow me to chat&nbsp;with Richard Hudson about transactional memory applications for concurrent GCs, listen to Dan Ingalls talk, discuss compiler design with people from Mozilla and Microsoft and make s'mores with Rickard Falkvinge&nbsp;- give me a call and I'll buy some tickets :-)</p>
<p>But there is another reason why JSConf was an invaluable experience for me: I like talking and sharing knowledge but both preparing and speaking is hard for me. Partially because I am not exactly very good in speaking English - my thoughts and jokes-cortex are accustomed to immense flexibility of Russian grammar. It's also always hard to fit both useful information and some entertainment into 30 minutes talk.</p>
<p>Yes, I&nbsp;do think that any talk should be both useful and entertaining. Some talks are entertaining but not useful. Some are highly useful but not entertaining. The balance is crucial.</p>
<p>When I was preparing my talk for JSConf 2012 I decided that I don't want to speak about V8 basics again: hidden classes, number representations, optimizing vs. non-optimizing compiler, flags to trace optimizations, profiler, generic performance advices. There are numerous presentations on this: from V8 developers&nbsp;<a href="http://s3.mrale.ph/nodecamp.eu/#1" title="Understanding V8" target="_blank">mine</a>, <a href="https://mkw.st/p/gdd11-berlin-v8-performance-tuning-tricks/#1" title="V8 Performance Tuning Tricks" target="_blank">Daniel Clifford's</a>, from Chrome DevRel team&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAqIpGU8ZZk" title="From Console to Chrome" target="_blank">Lilly Thomson's</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;from Mozilla SpiderMonkey team <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~dmandelin/KnowYourEngines_Velocity2011.pdf" title="Know Your Engines" target="_blank">David Mandelin's</a>. There are also numerous posts (<a href="http://blog.mrale.ph/post/14403172501/simple-optimization-checklist" target="_blank">some</a> on this blog, <a href="http://wingolog.org/tags/v8" target="_blank">some</a> in Andy Wingo's) plus <a href="https://plus.google.com/103716596068416580695/posts" target="_blank">+Florian Loitsch</a> started turning notes he took while working on Dart to JavaScript compiler <a href="http://floitsch.blogspot.com/search/label/V8" target="_blank">into blog posts</a>. I highly recommend reading them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus I considered foundations well covered and decided to choose a different goal for my talk: <em>I wanted to encourage people to look under V8's hood.&nbsp;</em>Following this decision I called my talk "Can V8 do that?!" and tried to demonstrate that V8 assembly and HIR can be quite readable with some practice and that they hide a lot of wonders. I don't yet know if I succeeded or failed, only future will tell, but I will monitor v8-dev &amp; v8-users mailing lists for questions about V8 internals and incoming patches :-)</p>
<p>I also have a suspicion that there are still might be some&nbsp;misunderstandings&nbsp;(e.g. if you think that V8 can <strong><em>always</em></strong> hoist expression like <code>a.length</code> from the loop please raise your hand in comments!). Nevertheless... I will continue to work on my ability to convey knowledge in an entertaining way and I am looking forward to my next talk: 1h with V8 internals in the beautiful Oslo at <a href="http://webrebels.org/" target="_blank">Web Rebels</a></p>
