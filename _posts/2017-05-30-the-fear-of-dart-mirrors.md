title: The fear of dart:mirrors
date: 2017-01-08

[`dart:mirrors`](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/1.21.1/dart-mirrors/dart-mirrors-library.html)
might be the most misunderstood, mistreated, neglected component of the Dart's
core libraries. It has been a part of Dart language since the very beginning and
is still surrounded by the fog of uncertainty and marked as _Status: Unstable_
in the documentation - even though APIs have not changed for a very long time.

`dart:mirrors` rarely hits spotlight because it is a library that enables
metaprogramming and as such an average Dart user rarely has to deal with it
directly - instead it is something framework/library authors have to deal with.

Indeed my journey towards this post did not actually start with `dart:mirrors`,
instead it started with something completely different:

## JSON deserialization

In December 2016 I was hanging out on Dart's Slack channel (now defunct in favor
of [`dart-lang` Gitter](https://gitter.im/dart-lang/home)) and saw a user, let
us call him Maximilian, inquiring about the ways to parse JSON in Dart. If you
are coming from JavaScript then this sort of question might surprise you: isn't
parsing JSON in Dart as easy as doing `JSON.parse(...)` in JavaScript?

Yes, it is _as easy_: you can simply use `JSON.decode(...)` from the built in
`dart:convert` library, however there is a catch. JavaScript's `JSON.parse` can
give you back an `object` because JavaScript objects are shapeless clouds of
properties and code like this is totally fine:

{% highlight javascript %}
let userData = JSON.parse(str);
console.log(`Got user ${userData.name} from ${userData.city}`);
{% endhighlight %}

However each Dart object has a fixed class which completely determines its
shape. Dart's `JSON.decode` can given you back a `Map` but it can't give you
back an object of your custom type:

{% highlight dart %}
Map userData = JSON.decode(str);
console.log("Got user ${userData['name']} from ${userData['city']}");  // OK

class UserData {
  String name;
  String city;
}

UserData userData = JSON.decode(str);  // NOT OK
console.log("Got user ${userData.name} from ${userData.city}");
{% endhighlight %}

One common solution to this problem is to write marshaling helpers that can
create your objects from `Map`s:

{% highlight dart %}
class UserData {
  String name;
  String city;

  UserData(this.name, this.city);

  UserDate.fromJson(Map m)
      : this(m['name'], m['city']);
}

UserData userData = new UserDate.fromJson(JSON.decode(str));
console.log("Got user ${userData.name} from ${userData.city}");
{% endhighlight %}

But writing this sort of boilerplate code is rarely a welcomed way to spend
the day. That's why [pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/) contains plenty of packages
that automate this and...
[_drumroll_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzAfTmC3It0)... some of them
use `dart:mirrors`.

### What is `dart:mirrors`?

If you are not a language person chances are that you have never heard the term
_mirror_ in connection with programming languages. It is a play of the words:
_mirror API_ allows program to reflect upon itself. Historically it originates
from SELF, like a lot of other great VM technology. Check out Gilad Bracha's
[post](https://gbracha.blogspot.dk/2010/03/through-looking-glass-darkly.html)
and follow the links if you want to learn more about mirrors and their role in
other systems.

Mirrors exist to answer _reflective_ questions like: <em>&laquo;What is the type
of the given object?&raquo;</em>, <em>&laquo;What fields/methods does it
have?&raquo;</em>, <em>&laquo;What is the type of field?&raquo;</em>,
<em>&laquo;What is the type of a parameter to the given method?&raquo;</em>
and to execute reflective actions like <em>&laquo;Get the value of this field
from that object!&raquo;</em> and <em>&laquo;Invoke this method on that
object!&raquo;</em>.

In JavaScript objects themselves posses reflective capabilities: to dynamically
get a property by name you can just do `obj[key]` to invoke a method by its name
with a dynamic list of arguments `obj[name].apply(obj, args)`.

Dart on the other hand encapsulates these capabilities within `dart:mirrors`
library:

{% highlight dart %}
import 'dart:mirrors' as mirrors;

setField(obj, name, value) {
  // Get an InstanceMirror that allows to access obj state
  final mirror = mirrors.reflect(obj);
  // Set the field through the mirror.
  mirror.setField(new Symbol(name), value);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The API might seem a bit wordy on the first glance, but in reality things like
`new Symbol(name)` are there for a reason: they remind you that names given to
classes, methods and fields are not there to stay - they might be changed,
mangled by the compiler in attempt to reduce the size of the generated code.
Keep this in mind we will return to this later.

### Back to JSON deserialization

Deserialization libraries based on `dart:mirrors` are usually extremely easy to
use: you just put an annotation on your classes and you are set. Here is for
example how data model from original Slack question by Maximilian looks like
with [`dartson`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dartson) annotations:

<small>[I renamed all the fields and classes to anonymize it. The structure of
the data model is retained.]</small>

{% highlight dart %}
import 'package:dartson/dartson.dart';

@Entity()
class Data {
  String something0;
  String something1;
  List<Data1> sublist0;
  List<Data2> sublist1;
  List<Data3> sublist2;
}

@Entity()
class Data1 {
  String something0;
  String something1;
  String something2;
  String something3;
  String something4;
  String something5;
  String something6;
}

@Entity()
class Data2 {
  String something0;
  String something1;
}

@Entity()
class Data3 {
  String something0;
  String something1;
}

final DSON = new Dartson.JSON();

// Deserialize Data object from a JSON encoded string.
Data d = DSON.decode(string, new Data());
{% endhighlight %}

Somebody might ask: if things are this simple and smooth what's the question
then?

It turns out `dartson` is really-really slow. When Maximilian took a 9Mb data
file containing the data he needed to work with he saw the following:

<pre>
$ dart decode-benchmark.dart --with-dartson
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
DSON.decode(...) took: <b style="color:red;">2654ms</b>
$ d8 decode-benchmark.js
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
JSON.parse(...) took: <b style="color: green;">118ms</b>
</pre>

These numbers don't look that great. Lets do a few more measurements:

<pre>
$ dart decode-benchmark.dart --with-json
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
JSON.decode(...) took: <b style="color:orange;">236ms</b>
</pre>

So just decoding JSON string into unstructured forest of `Map`s and `List`s is
10x faster than using `dartson`? That is rather disheartening and `dart:mirrors`
 are obviously to blame here! At least that's what Slack channel consensus on
 this issue was.

Before we dig a little bit deeper, I would like to make one observation here:
V8's JSON parser is [written in C++](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/master/src/json-parser.cc), Dart's is actually [written in Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart) and it is a streaming parser. 2x difference
between Dart's `JSON.decode(...)` and V8 `JSON.parse(...)` does not look _that_
bad when you realize this.

Another intersting thing here is to try and benchmark some other language that
uses reflection to deserialize JSON: Maximilian tried Go's `encoding/json`
package:

{% highlight go %}
import (
  "io/ioutil"
  "encoding/json"
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

type Data struct {
  Something0 string `json:"something0"`
  Something1 string `json:"something1"`
  Sublist0 []Data1 `json:"sublist0"`
  Sublist1 []Data2 `json:"sublist1"`
  Sublist2 []Data3 `json:"sublist2"`
}

var data Data
err := json.Unmarshal(data, &data)
{% endhighlight %}

<pre>
$ go run decode-benchmark.go
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
json.Unmarshal(...) took: <b style="color:orange;">279ms</b>
</pre>

So in Go deserializing JSON into a structure takes rougly the same time as in
Dart it takes to deserialize JSON into an unstructured `Map`s even though
`encoding/json` does use reflection to do it.

Here is a boxplot of times it takes to parse the same 9MB input file from
Maximilian (30 runs within the same process):

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/plot-0.png" class="centered"/>

`dartson` is absent from the picture because it is at least 10x slower than
anything else...

## Digging into `dartson` performance

As always one of the easiest ways to investigate performance of Dart code is to
use Observatory:

<pre>
$ dart <b>--observe</b> decode-benchmark.dart --dartson
Observatory listening on http://127.0.0.1:8181/
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
...
</pre>

Looking at the CPU profile page in the observatory reveals disturbing picture:

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/profile-0.png" class="centered"/>

This picture tells us that `dartson` is spending really large amount of time
interpolating strings. A quick look at the [source code](https://github.com/eredo/dartson/blob/01a33232bff83bd42366a7762f79a0a2064d8a2c/lib/dartson.dart)
reveals that `dartson` does a lot of logging like this:

{% highlight dart %}
void _fillObject(InstanceMirror objMirror, Map filler) {
  // ...
  _log.fine("Filled object completly: ${filler}");
}
{% endhighlight %}

and like this

{% highlight dart %}
Object _convertValue(TypeMirror valueType, Object value, String key) {
  // ...
  _log.finer('Convert "${key}": $value to ${symbolName}');
  // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is obviously a lot of wasted time because string interpolation is performed
even when logging is disabled. Thus the first step towards more performant
deserialization would be to completely remove all this logging:

<pre>
$ dart decode-benchmark.dart --with-dartson
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
DSON.decode(...) took: <b style="color:orange;">1542ms</b>
</pre>

Voil√†! We just made JSON deserialization with `dartson` **42%** faster by
changing something that has nothing to do with either mirrors or JSON. If we
look at the profile again then we discover that things are finally starting to
get interesting:

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/profile-1.png" class="centered"/>

Here we seem to repeatedly requesting mirror to compute _metadata_ associated
with some declaration. Lets look into [`Dartson._fillObject`](https://github.com/eredo/dartson/blob/01a33232bff83bd42366a7762f79a0a2064d8a2c/lib/dartson.dart#L157-L195):

{% highlight dart %}
void _fillObject(InstanceMirror objMirror, Map filler) {
  ClassMirror classMirror = objMirror.type;

  classMirror.declarations.forEach((sym, decl) {
    // Look at the declaration (e.g. a field) and make a decision
    // how to deserialize it from the given [filler] based on
    // the metadata associated with it and field's type.
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Whenever I face an optimization problem the first question I always ask myself
is _&laquo;Does this code repeats some operation? Can it be cached?&raquo;_.
For `Dartson._fillObject` answers are _Yes_ and _Yes_. The code above repeatedly
walks through all declarations in the given class and makes the very same
decisions again and again. These decisions can be cached because classes in Dart
don't change dynamically - they don't get new fields, nor fields change their
declared type. Lets restructure the code:

{% highlight dart %}
// For each class this cache contains a list of deserialization actions:
// "take a value from JSON map, convert it and store it in the given field".
// Actions are stored as triplets linearly in the list:
//
//     [jsonName_0, fieldName_0, convertion_0,
//      jsonName_1, fieldName_1, convertion_1,
//      ...]
//
final Map<ClassMirror, List> fillActionsCache = <ClassMirror, List>{};

/// Puts the data of the [filler] into the object in [objMirror]
/// Throws [IncorrectTypeTransform] if json data types doesn't match.
void _fillObject(InstanceMirror objMirror, Map filler) {
  ClassMirror classMirror = objMirror.type;

  var actions = fillActionsCache[classMirror];
  if (actions == null) {
    // We did not hit the cache and we need to compute a list of actions.
  }

  // Iterate all actions and execute those that have a matching field
  // in the [filler].
  for (var i = 0; i < actions.length; i += 3) {
    final jsonName = actions[i];
    final value = filler[jsonName];
    if (value != null) {
      final fieldName = actions[i + 1];
      final convert = actions[i + 2];
      objMirror.setField(fieldName, convert(jsonName, value));
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that we separately cache source `jsonName` and target `fieldName`
(as a `Symbol`) because field names don't necessary match source JSON property
names as `dartson` supports renamings via `@Property(name: ...)` annotation.
Another thing here is that we cache type conversions as a closure to avoid
repeatedly looking up field's type and figuring out which conversion to apply.

When we enter `_fillObject` for the first time with some class we need to
compute a list of deserialization actions for this class. Essentially it's the
same code that used to perform deserialization but instead of populating an
actual object we now populate a list of actions to perform:

{% highlight dart %}
actions = [];
classMirror.declarations.forEach((Symbol fieldName, decl) {
  // We are only interested in public non-constant fields and setters.
  if (!decl.isPrivate &&
      ((decl is VariableMirror && !decl.isFinal && !decl.isConst) ||
       (decl is MethodMirror && decl.isSetter))) {
    String jsonName = _getName(fieldName);
    TypeMirror valueType;

    if (decl is MethodMirror) { // Setter.
      // Setters are called `name=`. Remove trailing `=`.
      jsonName = jsonName.substring(0, jsonName.length - 1);
      valueType = decl.parameters[0].type;
    } else {  // Field.
      valueType = decl.type;
    }

    // Check if the property was renamed via @Property(name: ...)
    final Property prop = _getProperty(decl);
    if (prop?.name != null) {
      jsonName = prop.name;
    }

    // Populate actions.
    actions.add(jsonName);
    actions.add(fieldName);
    actions.add(_valueConverter(valueType));
  }
});

// No more actions will be added so convert actions list to non-growable array
// to reduce amount of indirections.
fillActionsCache[classMirror] = actions = actions.toList(growable: false);
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to this code we also have to rewrite [`Dartson._convertValue`](https://github.com/eredo/dartson/blob/01a33232bff83bd42366a7762f79a0a2064d8a2c/lib/dartson.dart#L201-L239).
In original `dartson` this function takes `TypeMirror` and a value to convert
and returns converted value:

{% highlight dart %}
Object _convertValue(TypeMirror valueType, Object value, String key) {
  if (valueType is ClassMirror &&
      !valueType.isOriginalDeclaration &&
      valueType.hasReflectedType &&
      !_hasOnlySimpleTypeArguments(valueType)) {
    ClassMirror classMirror = valueType;
    // handle generic lists
    if (classMirror.originalDeclaration.qualifiedName == _QN_LIST) {
      return _convertGenericList(classMirror, value);
    } else if (classMirror.originalDeclaration.qualifiedName == _QN_MAP) {
      // handle generic maps
      return _convertGenericMap(classMirror, value);
    }
  } // else if (...) {

  // ... various types handled here ...

  return value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

We follow the same idea as we applied to `_fillObject`, _instead of performing
conversion we compute how to perform the conversion_:

{% highlight dart %}
// Function that converts a [value] read from the JSON property to expected
// type.
typedef Object ValueConverter(String jsonName, Object value);

// Compute [ValueConverter] based on the property of the field where the
// the value taken from JSON map will be stored.
ValueConverter _valueConverter(TypeMirror valueType) {
  if (valueType is ClassMirror &&
      !valueType.isOriginalDeclaration &&
      valueType.hasReflectedType &&
      !_hasOnlySimpleTypeArguments(valueType)) {
    ClassMirror classMirror = valueType;
    // handle generic lists
    if (classMirror.originalDeclaration.qualifiedName == _QN_LIST) {
      return (jsonName, value) => _convertGenericList(classMirror, value); // ‚ö†
    } else if (classMirror.originalDeclaration.qualifiedName == _QN_MAP) {
      // handle generic maps
      return (jsonName, value) => _convertGenericMap(classMirror, value); // ‚ö†
    }
  } // else if (...) {

  // ... various types handled here ...

  // Identity convertion.
  return (jsonName, value) => value; // ‚ö†
}
{% endhighlight %}

With this optimizations `dartson` reaches new performance heights:

<pre>
$ dart decode-benchmark.dart --with-dartson
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
DSON.decode(...) took: <b style="color:orange;">488ms</b>
</pre>

This is **82%** faster than its original performance - with this we are finally
starting to approach numbers we are seeing from Go.

Can we push it further? Of course! Reading through the code and profiling
reveals few more obvious places where we could avoid repetetive reflective
overheads by applying the same optimization pattern we did before (*use
reflection to compute what to do, instead of doing it*). For example,
`_convertGenericList` contains the following code:

```dart
List _convertGenericList(ClassMirror listMirror, List fillerList) {
  ClassMirror itemMirror = listMirror.typeArguments[0];
  InstanceMirror resultList = _initiateClass(listMirror);
  fillerList.forEach((item) {
    (resultList.reflectee as List)
        .add(_convertValue(itemMirror, item, "@LIST_ITEM"));
  });
  return resultList.reflectee;
}
```

There are multiple issues with this code:

* adding items to the list one by one, causing growth and relocation - even
though list is know ahead of time;
* repetitively figuring out through reflection how to convert each individual
`item`;

The code can be easily rewritten using our `_valueConverter` helper:

```dart
List _convertGenericList(ClassMirror listMirror, List fillerList) {
  ClassMirror itemMirror = listMirror.typeArguments[0];
  InstanceMirror resultList = _initiateClass(listMirror);
  final List result = resultList.reflectee as List;

  // Compute how to convert list items based on itemMirror *once*
  // outside of the loop.
  final convert = _valueConverter(itemMirror);

  // Presize the list.
  result.length = fillerList.length;

  for (var i = 0; i < fillerList.length; i++) {
    result[i] = convert("@LIST_ITEM", fillerList[i]);
  }

  return result;
}
```

Another small optimization that could be done in the `dartson` code is caching
class initiators and moving away from:

```dart
// code from _valueConverter handling convertion from Map
// to object.
return (key, value) {
  var obj = _initiateClass(valueType);
  // ...
  // fill obj from value
  // ...
  return obj.reflectee;
};
```

to

```dart
final init = _classInitiator(valueType);
return (key, value) {
  var obj = init();
  // ...
  // fill obj from value
  // ...
  return obj.reflectee;
};
```

It is again exactly the same pattern we applied before so I will not bother you
with implementation details.

<pre>
$ dart decode-benchmark.dart --with-dartson
loaded data.json: 9389696 bytes
DSON.decode(...) took: <b style="color:green;">304ms</b>
</pre>

We have now made dartson **89%** faster than its original performance!
Furthermore it turns out that warmed up performance of this code is actually
rivaling that of Go:

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/plot-1.png" class="centered"/>

Can we push performance further? Certainly! If we look at our deserialization
chain: from `String` to `Map` to an actual forest of objects then the very
first step stands out as redundant. We seem to be allocating `Map` just
to fill an actual object from it. Can we parse string directly into an object?

If we look closely at Dart VM sources for its [JSON parser](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart)
we will discover that it is split into two pieces: [the actual parser](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/9a64339646014527f0fdd8e0f5b6a7466fd375b6/runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart#L258-L266)
which walks the input (a single `String` or a sequence of chunks arriving
asynchronously) and sends events like `beginObject`, `beginArray` to [the listener](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/9a64339646014527f0fdd8e0f5b6a7466fd375b6/runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart#L92-L98) which constructs the objects. Unfortunately neither `_ChunkedJsonParser` nor listener interface `_JsonListener` are hidden within `dart:convert` and user code can't use them.

At least before we apply this small patch:

```diff

With `JsonListener` and `parseJsonWithListener` exposed from `dart:convert` we
can build our own `JsonListener` that does not create any intermediate maps but
instead fills actual objects as parser walks the string.

I have quickly prototyped such parser and while I am not going to walk you
through each single line of the code, I am going to highlight some of my design
decisions. Full code available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mraleph/7dc5b77b6a77d3d6bb88709945dbd02c).

### Converting `Type` into auxiliary data-structures once ahead of time

```dart
/// Deserialization descriptor built from a [Type] or a [mirrors.TypeMirror].
/// Describes how to instantiate an object and how to fill it with properties.
class TypeDesc {
  /// Tag describing what kind of object this is: expected to be
  /// either [tagArray] or [tagObject]. Other tags ([tagString], [tagNumber],
  /// [tagBoolean]) are not used for [TypeDesc]s.
  final int tag;

  /// Constructor closure for this object.
  final Constructor ctor;

  /// Either map from property names to property descriptors for objects or
  /// element [TypeDesc] for lists.
  final /* Map<String, Property> | TypeDesc */ properties;
}

/// Deserialization descriptor built from a [mirrors.VariableMirror].
/// Describes what kind of value is expected for this property and how
/// how to store it in the object.
class Property {
  /// Either [TypeDesc] if the property is a [List] or an object or
  /// [tagString], [tagBool], [tagNumber] if the property has primitive type.
  final /* int | TypeDesc */ desc;

  /// Setter callback.
  final Setter assign;

  Property(this.desc, this.assign);
}
```

As our work on `dartson` showed it pays off to only use mirrors once to build
auxiliary data structures describing deserialization actions in some form.

In my mirror based deserializer I follow the same route, but instead of doing
it lazily I do it eagerly and cache the result.

### Dynamically adapting to the order of properties in JSON

One interesting observation that can be made by looking at JSON is that
properties for objects of the same type are usually arriving in the same order.

This means that could take a page from me V8's playbook and adapt to this order
dynamically to avoid doing dictionary lookup in `TypeDesc.properties` for each
new property.

The way I implemented this in the prototype is very straightforward - I simply
record properties in order for the first object with the given `TypeDesc` and
then attempt to follow the recorded *trail*. This approach works well for our
sample JSON but might be to naive for the real world full or optional
properties.

```dart
class TypeDesc {
  /// Mode determining whether this [TypeDesc] is trying to adapt to
  /// a particular order of properties in the incoming JSON:
  /// the expectation here is that if JSON contains several serialized objects
  /// of the same type they will all have the same order of properties inside.
  int mode = modeAdapt;

  /// A sequence of triplets (property name, hydrate callback, assign callback)
  /// recorded while trying to adapt to the property order in the incoming JSON.
  /// If [mode] is set to [modeFollow] then [HydratingListener] will attempt
  /// to follow the trail.
  List<dynamic> propertyTrail = [];
}

class HydratingListener extends JsonListener {
  @override
  void propertyName() {
    if (desc.mode == TypeDesc.modeNone || desc.mode == TypeDesc.modeAdapt) {
      // This is either the first time we encountered an object with such
      // [TypeDesc], which means we are currently recording the [propertyTrail]
      // or we have already failed to follow the [propertyTrail] and have fallen
      // back to simple dictionary based property lookups.
      final p = desc.properties[value];
      if (p == null) {
        throw "Unexpected property ${name}, only expect: ${desc.properties.keys
            .join(', ')}";
      }

      if (desc.mode == TypeDesc.modeAdapt) {
        desc.propertyTrail.add(value);
        desc.propertyTrail.add(p.desc);
        desc.propertyTrail.add(p.assign);
      }
      prop = p;
      expect(p.desc);
    } else {
      // We are trying to follow the trail.
      final name = desc.propertyTrail[prop++];
      if (name != value) {
        // We failed to follow the trail. Fall back to the simple dictionary
        // based lookup.
        desc.mode = TypeDesc.modeNone;
        desc.propertyTrail = null;
        return propertyName();
      }

      // We are still on the trail.
      final propDesc = desc.propertyTrail[prop++];
      expect(propDesc);
    }
  }
}
```

### Dynamically generated setter closures

Even though we mostly avoid using mirrors during parsing, we are still forced
to use them to set fields when filling objects:

```dart
final Setter setField = (InstanceMirror obj, dynamic value) {
  obj.setField(fieldNameSym, value);
};
```

If we look into Dart VM sources [we discover](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/8f1a69826a775f28c6c6e8c469e848aea5cde471/runtime/lib/mirrors_impl.dart#L464-L498)
that it used dynamic code generation to speedup `InstanceMirror.setField`: it
generates and caches small closures of form `(x, v) => x.$fieldName = v` and
uses them to assign fields instead of going through generic runtime path.

There is an obvious optimization opportunity here: instead of defining
`setField` as closure that calls `InstanceMirror.setField` which would in turn
lookup another closure and invoke it to set the field, we want to define
`setField` to be *that* very closure which sets the field directly.

There are two ways to achieve that:

* Massage Dart VM's optimizing compiler to teach it how to specialize
`InstanceMirror.setField` call-sites when the first parameter is either a
constant or a pseudo-constant i.e. an immutable captured variable. This is a
very complicated path.
* Apply a small patch to Dart VM's sources to expose dynamic code evaluation
capabilities:

```diff

and use these capabilities to rewrite our `setField`

```dart
final setField = mirrors.$evaluate('''(obj, value) {
  obj.reflectee.${fieldNameStr} = value;
}''');
```

### Results

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/plot-2.png" class="centered"/>

Our prototype labeled `ŒºDecode` and `ŒºDecode*` on the plot written in Dart and
using mirrors is doing respectably well against the competition and is
approaching the performance of hand-tuned C++ parser used by V8.

The only difference between `ŒºDecode` and `ŒºDecode*` is that `ŒºDecode*` is using
`mirrors.$evaluate` to generate field setter closures, while `ŒºDecode` is
sticking to public `dart:mirrors` API.

You might notice that this plot also mentions a new player `source_gen`, which
we did not encounter before.

## The problem with mirrors

I hopefully managed to demonstrate that mirrors perform well within JIT compiled
environment provided by the Dart VM. Unfortunately the picture would not be
complete if I did not cover how mirrors perform in the AOT compiled
environments.

Currently Dart has to ahead-of-time compiled targets:

* `dart2js` is an AOT compiler targeting browser environment by compiling Dart
to JavaScript;
* `dart_boostrap` is a VM based AOT compiler targeting native code.

The picture with mirrors here is really dire - VM's AOT configuration currently
does not support `dart:mirrors` at all, while `dart2js` supports it only
partially and prints an angry warning whenever you compile an application
importing `dart:mirrors`.

The reason why AOT compiler shy away from `dart:mirrors` is its unrestricted
reflective power which allows you to explore, modify and
dynamically invoke anything you can reach transitively. AOT compilers usually
operate under the closed-world assumption that allows them to determine with
varying degree of precision instances of which classes are potentially
allocated, which methods are potentially called (and which are certainly not
called), and even what are the values reaching a particular field. Reflective
capabilities of `dart:mirrors` significantly complicate and degrade the quality
of global data flow and control flow analyses. Thus AOT compilers have a choice:

* Decline to implement `dart:mirrors` - this is what VM have chosen to do;
* Make analyses conservative when `dart:mirrors` is used - this is what
`dart2js` chose to do;
* implement more sophisticated control and data flow analyses that can cope with
some reflective capabilities;
* fix `dart:mirrors` APIs to be more declarative to aid AOT compilation.

We will get back to the last option later, but lets first look at where current
`dart2js`'s choice gets us. If we compile our benchmark to JavaScript via `dart2js`
and run it in a relatively new V8 we will see results like this:

<img src="/images/2017-01-08/plot-3.png" class="centered"/>

<small>[Note: `dartson` comes with a <em>transformer</em> which erases
`dart:mirrors` usage but I am intentionally not using it here because I want to
measure overhead of `dart:mirrors`]</small>

We can clearly see that we are taking at least 4x penalty for using mirrors
against the baseline: `dart2js` output is using `JSON.parse` so it makes total
sense to use `V8 JSON` as a baseline when trying to establish the amount of
overhead that our abstractions are adding on top of native JSON parser.

Additionally importing `dart:mirrors` completely disables tree-shaker so the
output contains all the code from all the libraries imported
transitively - most of this code will never be used by the application itself,
but `dart2js` has to conservatively assume that it can be potentially reached
through mirrors.

Web developers obviously want smaller and faster JavaScript output so libraries
like [`source_gen`](https://github.com/dart-lang/source_gen) sprung into
existence.

<small>[Before <code>source_gen</code> there were <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/assets-and-transformers"><code>pub</code>-transformers</a>,
but because Dart ecosystem is moving away from them I am not going to go into details here. The main difference between transformers and `source_gen` is
that `source_gen` generates files on disk that you are supposed to carry around and even commit into your repo, while transformers operated in-memory as
part of the <code>pub</code>-pipeline, making them invisible for tools that were not integrated with <code>pub</code>. Transformers were very powerful
but unwieldy which lead to their demise. In general you don't want to do expensive global transformations, and especially you don't want to do them in
memory. What you really want is modular transformations with cachable intermediate results for faster incremental builds.]</small>

Instead of abstracting away boilerplate code using reflective
capabilities, you write a tool that generates boilerplate for you. For example,
if you write in file called `decode.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:source_gen/generators/json_serializable.dart';
part 'decode.g.dart';


@JsonSerializable()
class Data extends Object with _$DataSerializerMixin {
  final String something0;
  final List<Data1> sublist0;
  final List<Data2> sublist1;
  final String something1;
  final List<Data3> sublist2;

  Data(this.something0, this.sublist0, this.sublist1, this.something1, this.sublist2);

  factory Data.fromJson(json) => _$DataFromJson(json);
}
```

then you run `source_gen` and you get a file `decode.g.dart` which contains all
the serialization/deserializaton boilerplate:

```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND

part of mirrors.src.source_gen.decode;

// **************************************************************************
// Generator: JsonSerializableGenerator
// Target: class Data
// **************************************************************************

Data _$DataFromJson(Map json) => new Data(
    json['something0'] as String,
    (json['sublist0'] as List)
        ?.map((v0) => v0 == null ? null : new Data1.fromJson(v0))
        ?.toList(),
    (json['sublist1'] as List)
        ?.map((v0) => v0 == null ? null : new Data2.fromJson(v0))
        ?.toList(),
    json['something1'] as String,
    (json['sublist2'] as List)
        ?.map((v0) => v0 == null ? null : new Data3.fromJson(v0))
        ?.toList());

abstract class _$DataSerializerMixin {
  String get something0;
  List get sublist0;
  List get sublist1;
  String get something1;
  List get sublist2;
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => <String, dynamic>{
        'something0': something0,
        'sublist0': sublist0,
        'sublist1': sublist1,
        'something1': something1,
        'sublist2': sublist2
      };
}
```

This looks pretty awful (and still not completely free of boilerplate), but it
works. Resulting code is fully visible to the AOT compiler and uses no mirrors -
so compiler does as good of a job as it would do if you would write the same
boilerplate by hand - resulting in smaller and faster JavaScript outputs.

For comparison, JavaScript output for `source_gen` based benchmark is 12x
smaller and 2x faster than `dartson`-mirror-based one.

However `source_gen` based solution:

* it still around 2x slower than native baseline;
* looks very unpleasant to the eye;

### Why is it slower?

The main reason for it being slower is that we still allocated intermediate
results: instead of going directly `String` to object, we first invoke
`dart:convert.JSON.parse` to produce a forest of `Map` and `List` objects, which we then
convert into actual "typed" objects.

If we look under the hood of [`dart:convert` implementation](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/8619cb63878d5be7ad714f1eb5867cc828d0d1e9/sdk/lib/_internal/js_runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart#L13-L46)
provided by `dart2js`, then we discover that things are even more convoluted:
because native `JSON.parse` returns a JS object which is not compatible with
Dart's `Map` we need to [wrap it up](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/8619cb63878d5be7ad714f1eb5867cc828d0d1e9/sdk/lib/_internal/js_runtime/lib/convert_patch.dart#L126)
so that it will start behaving like a proper `Map`.

All these indirections and data marshaling between three worlds (JavaScript
&rArr; Dart `Map` &rArr; Dart class instances) comes at a cost and to be honest
it is unclear if there are really easy ways to improve it. One thing though
is clear - `dart2js` could probably have come with a first class
support for JSON, in a form of special annotations similar `@JsonSerializable`.
Then it could implement support for JSON serialization/deserialization with
minimal copying (e.g. by lazily patching prototypes of objects returned by
native `JSON.parse`).

### How to make it prettier?

While `dart2js` could have implemented first class support for JSON, it is just
one of many serialization formats in the world, so it seems a better solution
is necessary. `source_gen` does the job but it is not pretty. `dart:mirrors` are
pretty but have implications in AOT environments. What can we do?

There are at least two possible solutions here.

#### More declarative replacement for `dart:mirrors`

The problem with `dart:mirrors` is that it is *imperative* and *unrestricted* in
its capabilities making it very hard to analyze statically. What if Dart
language provided a reflection library which required you to declare statically:

* a set of reflection capabilities that you are going to use;
* a set of classes which you are going to apply those capabilities to.

This might sound to restrictive - but if you think back to our JSON
deserialization example if you will realize that:

* we only need to access classes that are marked with `@Entity()` annotation;
* we need to be able to invoke default constructor of those classes;
* we only need want to iterate their fields, know their types and know how to
assign those fields;

A lot of other applications of mirrors are similarly limited: there is an
annotation they are looking for and they only perform a certain limited subset
of actions over annotated classes.

This observation lead to development of [`reflectable`](https://github.com/dart-lang/reflectable/tree/master/reflectable)
package as an experiment. This package is centered around the idea of
declaratively specifying [reflection capabilities](https://github.com/dart-lang/reflectable/blob/master/reflectable/doc/TheDesignOfReflectableCapabilities.md).

Unfortunately development of `reflectable` stagnated and it never became part of
the core, which means it has to rely on dreaded _transformers_ to generate
small and fast output on `dart2js`. Hopefully at some point we will reevaluate
benefits of `reflectable` and revive it.

#### Compile time metaprogramming / macro-system

You probably noticed that both `source_gen` and `reflectable` approach the
problem from a similar angle: they generate code based on the code you have
written. So it seems that Dart could really benefit from a good macro-system.

This might seem like something from the land of PL dreams because no truly
mainstream language sported good macro-system. However I think a lot of
developers started to realize that syntax level abstractions are an extremely
useful and powerful tool - and language designers are no longer afraid to
provide tools that are too powerful. Here are some examples of modern days
macro-systems in [Scala](http://scalameta.org/), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/macros.html)
and [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/).

For Dart macro-system seemed like impossibility for a very long time, due to a
whole zoo of parsers running around (VM has one written in C++, `dart2js`
another one written in Dart and `dart_analyzer` has the third one originally
written in Java and now Dart). However with the recent attempt to unify all
Dart tools behind the same common front-end written in Dart and generating
[Kernel](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/kernel) it finally
becomes possible to experiment with introducing a macro-system that will be
uniformly supported across all tools from IDE to VM and dart2js compiler.

This is still a dream but a dream that seems well within a grasp.
