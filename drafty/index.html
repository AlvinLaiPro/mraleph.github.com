      <p>This page is a simple tool that allows you to view MTGO and share draft logs. Load a log using "Choose File" button.</p>
      <p>Note that draft log is <em>not</em> uploaded anywhere when you load it. To upload draft log (e.g. for sharing with somebody) press "Share" button.
        Your log will be uploaded to <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist.github.com</a> as an anonymous gist and you will receive an URL of the form <pre style="text-align: center;">http://mrale.ph/drafty/#...</pre> to use for sharing.</p>
      <p>Please note that once the log is uploaded it becomes public and can't be easily deleted. Refer to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-an-anonymous-gist/">GitHub Help</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>All images are fetched from <a href="https://deckbrew.com/">https://deckbrew.com/</a></p>
      <p>(Button "Show Taken Cards" allows you to see which cards were in this booster when it passed you before)</p>
