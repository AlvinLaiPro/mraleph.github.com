# "Smalltalk"-ified benchmarks

Note this is not a fully functional implementation of a smalltalk runtime. It's an illustration of how certain techniques can be useful when implementing aforementioned runtime on top of JavaScript VM.

This folder contains versions of the code used to reproduce the numbers on the slides.

You can benchmark individual steps with 

    $ d8 sX.js measure.js

You can check semantics implemented in a particular step with

    $ d8 sX.js semantics.js
